Project Information: Multi-Scale Retail Demand Forecasting by Deep Learning
In the modern retail environment, accurately forecasting demand is the key to increasing sales and optimizing inventory management. This project aims to build a multi-scale retail demand forecasting model using deep learning technology.

Project objective: To develop a deep learning model that can accurately predict product demand on different time scales (e.g., day, week, month) based on historical sales data, market trends, and seasonal factors.

Main work:

Data collection and preprocessing: Collect historical sales data from multiple retailers and public data sets for data cleaning and feature engineering.
Model design: Deep learning algorithms such as long short-term memory network (LSTM) are used to design and implement demand prediction models.
Multi-scale analysis: Demand forecasting on different time scales (short and long term) to ensure flexibility and adaptability of the model.
Model evaluation: Indicators such as root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used to evaluate the model and compare it with traditional forecasting methods.
Expected Results: Through this project, retailers are expected to significantly improve their demand forecasting accuracy, thereby helping them manage inventory more effectively and improve customer satisfaction.
